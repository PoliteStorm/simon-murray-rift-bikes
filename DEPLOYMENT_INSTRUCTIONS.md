# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - SUPER EASY!

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: Changes are already pushed to GitHub!

Your changes are now live on GitHub at:
https://github.com/PoliteStorm/simon-murray-rift-bikes

## 🎯 What Happens Next (Automatic!)

Since your site is hosted on **Netlify**, it should **automatically deploy** the new changes!

### How to Check if it's Deploying:

1. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Open: https://app.netlify.com
   - Login with your account

2. **Find Your Site:**
   - Look for "simon-murray-rift-bikes" in your sites list
   - Click on it

3. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - You'll see a yellow "Building" badge if it's deploying
   - Or a green "Published" badge if it's done
   - Usually takes 2-5 minutes

## 🔄 If It Doesn't Auto-Deploy (Manual Deploy)

If Netlify didn't automatically start deploying:

### Option 1: Trigger Deploy in Netlify (Easiest)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click on your site "simon-murray-rift-bikes"
3. Click the **"Deploys"** tab at the top
4. Click the **"Trigger deploy"** button
5. Select **"Deploy site"**
6. Wait 2-5 minutes

### Option 2: From GitHub (Alternative)

1. Go to: https://github.com/PoliteStorm/simon-murray-rift-bikes/settings/hooks
2. Find the Netlify webhook
3. Click "Edit"
4. Click "Redeliver" on the latest delivery
5. Wait 2-5 minutes

---

## 📱 How to See Your Changes Live

Once deployed (green "Published" badge in Netlify):

1. **Find Your Live URL:**
   - In Netlify, it shows your site URL at the top
   - Usually something like: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
   - Or your custom domain if you set one up

2. **View the Site:**
   - Click the URL or copy/paste into browser
   - You should see all the new changes!

3. **Clear Your Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - This forces a fresh reload
